# Life Of A Solar Panel

## Description
Game for public engagement about solar infrastructures and energy futures
Served from a solar-powered Raspberry Pi LAN

What might the world look like if our societies, communication technologies, and economies were organized around the energy and cycles of the sun rather than fossil fuels?

We invite everyone to engage with this question by connecting to our mini mobile solar server.

It can be setup anywhere outside and be transported on a cargo bike. As a pop-up, temporary installation in public spaces, it facilitates public engagement and social interaction on low-carbon energy futures and solar computing. 

Passersby and invited guests can connect their own portable device to the server and access a text-based Twine game called “Life of a solar panel”. This game serves as a prompt for conversation and vision-building for just climate futures. A small GB Studio prequel can be played on a hacked solar-powered Game Boy.

The hardware setup consists of a solar panel, battery, charge controller, and Raspberry Pi computer. These components can easily be sourced from second hand markets and are relatively affordable. The mobile solar server can thus be re-created for public engagements of all kinds!
